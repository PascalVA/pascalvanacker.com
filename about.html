        <p># A little bit about myself</p>

        <p>My name is Pascal. I am a tech enthusiast,
        as you can probably tell by my awesome website design. ;-)
        Born and raised in Belgium, I like all the good things
        that are typical of my country:<br />
        **French (??)** fries, beer, chocolate, waffles and for those who know me,
        a good pain saucisse.<p />

        <p>I am currently working as a DevOps engineer at Tadaweb,
        an amazing company based in Luxembourg. They are always looking for amazing
        folks to join the team, so be sure to check them out at
        <a target="_blank" href=http://www.tadaweb.com>tadaweb.com</a>.<p />

        <p>As a DevOps engineer and SRE, I am, together with my team, responsible for
        the automation, monitoring and support of the it infrastructure that we
        provision for our clients on various bare-metal servers and clouds.<br />
        Besides that, we also take care of our CI/CD pipelines and work together
        with developers to increase productivity and efficiency.</p>

        <p>Before that, I spent about five years working as a Linux system administrator
        at an SMO based in Leuven. I was managing and automating the Linux infrastructure
        and networking while also providing the build infrastructure for a CI/CD pipeline.
        On top of that my days were mixed with a hint of windows client and server systems.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I like to mess with computers, play some video games, eat and spend
        time with my friends and family. I've also been known to like a dad joke or two.</p>
